  <p>The Baics of the Web & HTML</p>
The world wide web is made up of HTML documents that can be connected via hyperlinks.<br>
The main pieces of the web:<br> 
<ol>computer user</ol><ol>computer & browser</ol><ol>the internet</ol><ol>servers</ol>
<p>HTML</p>
HTML documents are the heart of the web and are made up of text, content, the HTML mark-up, references to other documents and links
<p>TAGS</p>
Tags are used to mark-up HTML documents for formating. A tag consists of an opening tag <name>content and a closing tag</name>
the whole tage is called an element
<p>Computers are stupid</p>
Computers are very dumb machines, they will only do what the programmer tells the machine what to do.  Because of this, programmers need to be precise on instructions and be sensative to typos in the markup
<p>Links</p>
Links are used to connect an HTML document to any other document on the <a href="www.espn.com">web</a>.
In the previous sentence, web is highlighted in blue and links to www.espn.com. 
<p>Inline tags vs Block tags</p>
Inline tags just end a sentence where you put the br tag
Block tags create an invisable box around the text where the box can be formatted
Block tags are the Paragraph tags
